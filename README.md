# Ad-Engagement-Prediction-Model
# Ad Engagement Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict user engagement with digital advertisements. By analyzing various user attributes, ad characteristics, and contextual information, the system aims to forecast the likelihood of engagement (e.g., clicks or conversions), enabling advertisers to optimize campaign performance and improve return on investment.

## Importance of Solving This Problem

### Why It Matters

* **Optimized Ad Spend**: Predicting engagement allows efficient resource allocation to high-performing ads.
* **Improved Campaign ROI**: Higher CTR and conversion rates mean better returns on investment.
* **Enhanced User Experience**: Relevant ads improve satisfaction and reduce ad fatigue.
* **Personalized Marketing**: Aligns ads with individual user profiles and behaviors.
* **Real-time Decision Making**: Enables dynamic ad placements and bidding strategies.
* **Competitive Advantage**: Companies with accurate predictions outperform competitors.
* **Data-Driven Insights**: Helps refine targeting, design, and overall marketing strategies.

## Features

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

* Loads ad engagement dataset.
* Displays data types, distributions, and missing values.

### 2. Comprehensive Data Preprocessing

* One-hot encodes categorical features (e.g., `ad_type`, `user_location`, `device_type`).
* Applies `StandardScaler` to numerical features (`age`, `time_spent_on_site`).
* Feature engineering: extracts `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week` from timestamps.

### 3. Handling Imbalanced Data

* Uses **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance engagement classes.

### 4. Feature Selection

* Uses **SelectKBest** with `f_classif` to identify top predictive features.

### 5. Machine Learning Model Training

* Trains a **RandomForestClassifier**.
* Optimizes model using **GridSearchCV**.

### 6. Thorough Model Evaluation

* Metrics: `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`, `roc_auc_score`.
* Visualization: **Precision-Recall Curve**.

### 7. Model Persistence

* Saves trained model and preprocessing pipeline using **pickle**.

### 8. Ad Engagement Prediction Function

* Defines a function `predict_engagement()` to predict engagement for new ad impressions.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**: Data manipulation and computation.
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: Visualization.
* **Scikit-learn**: ML pipeline, preprocessing, training, evaluation.
* **Imbalanced-learn**: SMOTE for class imbalance.
* **Pickle**: Model and pipeline persistence.
* **Time**: Runtime measurement.
* **Warnings**: For cleaner logs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Download Notebook and Dataset**:

   * Download `Ad Engagement Prediction.ipynb`.
   * Save `ad_engagement_data.csv` in the same folder.

2. **Install Libraries**:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

---

## Usage

### Open and Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook "Ad Engagement Prediction.ipynb"
```

### Run All Cells

* Loads and cleans data.
* Performs EDA.
* Handles class imbalance.
* Selects features.
* Trains & tunes the RandomForest model.
* Saves best model and pipeline.
* Defines `predict_engagement()` for new predictions.

### Make New Predictions

```python
new_ad_impression = {
    'age': 30,
    'gender': 'Male',
    'ad_type': 'Banner',
    'user_location': 'Urban',
    'device_type': 'Mobile',
    'time_spent_on_site': 120.5,
    'timestamp': '2024-03-15 14:30:00'
}

# After loading model and preprocessor
engagement_prediction_result = predict_engagement(new_ad_impression, loaded_model, loaded_preprocessor)
print("Ad Engagement Prediction:", engagement_prediction_result)
```

## Future Enhancements

* **Real-time Inference API**: Serve predictions with Flask/FastAPI.
* **A/B Testing Framework**: Evaluate model impact in real-world campaigns.
* **More Complex Models**: Explore deep learning, transformers, etc.
* **Causal Inference**: Estimate actual impact of ads on engagement.
* **Dynamic Bidding**: Use predictions in real-time bidding strategies.
* **Feedback Loops**: Use user feedback to retrain and improve models.
